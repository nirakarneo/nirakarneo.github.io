Let $$V_{\mathbb{R}}$$ be a real vector space. The complexification of $$V_{\mathbb{R}}$$ is a complex vector space $$V_{\mathbb{C}}$$, which in one way may be regarded as $$V_{\mathbb{R}}+iV_{\mathbb{R}}$$ with the rules of addition and scalar mutliplication appropriately defined. Natural questions to ask - 

*   If $$V_{\mathbb{R}}$$ has additional structures like having norm, etc., do they also extend to its complexification?
*   Conversely, if the complexification has some addition property, does the original space also has that property?

The other topic is about Chebyshev sets. Recall that in a Hilbert space $$H$$, if $$C$$ is a closed convex nonempty set and $$x\in H$$ then there exists a unique point in $$x_0\in C$$ such that the $$\|x-x_0\|=\text{dist}(x,C):=\{\|x-y\|:y\in C\}.$$ In general, if $$V$$ is a normed space and if $$C\subset V$$ is a nonempty set with the property that for every $$x\in V$$ there exists a unique $$x_0\in C$$ such that $$\|x_0-x\|=\text{dist}(x,C)$$ then such a set $$C$$ is called a Chebyshev set. The most general question is to find (necessary and sufficient) conditions on $$V$$ and/or $$C$$ which ensure that $$C$$ is a Chebyshev set. For example, the sufficient conditions in a Hilbert space is that the set $$C$$ should be closed and convex. It is an oper question whether convexity is a necessary condition in the case of a Hilbert space.
