*This is a random quote.* _ Lincoln


**This is another random quote.** - Einstein

<blockquote>
  <p>I will write about all of this one day, he thinks, and knows it’s just a dawn
thought, an after-dreaming thought. But it’s nice to think so for a while in the
morning’s clean silence, to think that childhood has its own sweet secrets and
confirms mortality, and that mortality defines all courage and love. To think
that what has looked forward must also look back, and that each life makes its
own imitation of immortality: a wheel.<br />
Or so Bill Denbrough sometimes thinks on those early mornings after dreaming,
when he almost remembers his childhood, and the friends with whom he shared it. - Stephen King</p>

<p><em>“It”</em>, Stephen King</p>
