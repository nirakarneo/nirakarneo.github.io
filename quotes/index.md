> We do not choose mathematics as our profession, it chooses us. [*Yuri Manin*, [source](http://www.ams.org/notices/200910/rtx091001268p.pdf)]

> Mathematics is a process of staring hard enough with enough perseverence at at the fog of muddle and confusion to eventually break through to improved clarity. I'm happy when I can admit, at least to myself, that my thinking is muddled, and I try to overcome the embarrassment that I might reveal ignorance or confusion.
> Over the years, this has helped me develop clarity in some things, but I remain muddled in many others.
> I enjoy questions that seem honest, even when they admit or reveal confusion, in preference to questions that appear designed to project sophistication. [*Bill Thurston*, [source](http://mathoverflow.net/users/9062/bill-thurston)]

> I was lucky enough to attend a few lectures of S. S. Chern just before he retired from Berkeley in which he said that the cotangent bundle (differential forms) is the feminine side of analysis on manifolds, and the tangent bundle (vector fields) is the masculine side. From this perspective, Hamiltonian mechanics is the feminine side of classical physics, [and] its masculine side is Lagrangian mechanics. [*Richard Montgomery*, [source](http://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/papers/Symm_in_Mech_Review.PDF)]

> ego cogito, ergo sum [*RenÃ© Descartes*, [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum#Principles_of_Philosophy)]

> Suppose we loosely define a religion as any discipline whose foundations rest on an element of faith, irrespective of any element of reason which may be present. Quantum mechanics for example would be a religion under this definition. But mathematics would hold the unique position of being the only branch of theology possessing a rigorous demonstration of the fact that it should be so classified. [*F. De Sua* cited in H. Eves's *Mathematical Circles*]
