> We do not choose mathematics as our profession, it chooses us. [*Yuri Manin*, [source](http://www.ams.org/notices/200910/rtx091001268p.pdf)]

> Mathematics is a process of staring hard enough with enough perseverence at at the fog of muddle and confusion to eventually break through to improved clarity. I'm happy when I can admit, at least to myself, that my thinking is muddled, and I try to overcome the embarrassment that I might reveal ignorance or confusion.
> Over the years, this has helped me develop clarity in some things, but I remain muddled in many others.
> I enjoy questions that seem honest, even when they admit or reveal confusion, in preference to questions that appear designed to project sophistication. [*Bill Thurston*, [source](http://mathoverflow.net/users/9062/bill-thurston)]
